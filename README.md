# NRASH
Nrash is a simple tool to work with your trash folder. This is my custom implementation of trash-cli, using Nim.

Features:
nrash - Delete File(s)/Folder(s)
nrash_list - Show files in trash

Why is it pronounced 'Nash' and not 'Nrash'? It is to show off the performance of the software course! It's so fast that the letter 'r' has already been deleted once you finish saying 'N'!
